<p>FS5001 series mass flow sensors are designed for general purpose flow   monitoring and control applications. The sensors directly measure mass   flow in the designed channel with trace flow <br />
  detection capability. The lowest flow it can detect is 20 μ L/min. These sensors can readily be <br />
  applied for manifold flow assembly, leak detection, HVAC control, clean room air flow or nitrogen <br />
  flush monitoring and control, environmental equipments such as air sampler, analytical <br />
instrumentation such as GC spectrometer.</p>

<h3>Product Specification</h3>
<p>FS5001 series mass flow sensors are designed for general purpose flow monitoring and control<br />
  applications. The sensors directly measure mass flow in the designed channel with trace flow <br soft="" />
  detection capability. The lowest flow it can detect is 20 μ L/min. These sensors can readily be <br soft="" />
  applied for manifold flow assembly, leak detection, HVAC control, clean room air flow or nitrogen <br soft="" />
  flush monitoring and control, environmental equipments such as air sampler, analytical <br soft="" />
  instrumentation such as GC spectrometer.<br />
  <br />
  FS5001 can be configured to measure flow full scale from 100 sccm to 1000 sccm (1 SLPM). <br soft="" />
  With a full spectrum of customizable adaptors, it can be plug-and-play in many applications.<br />
  <br />
